### About Me

   <img align="right" src="http://cjacquelineq.github.io/profile.jpg" width="240">  

- I am a fourth year student at UC Davis major in Statistics and Economics (Degree expected in June 2017).  
- I am from Guangdong, China. I currently live in Davis, California, USA.
- I am interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and I took some related courses:  
  [STA 141A: Fundamentals of Statistical Data Science](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/courses/expanded-course-descriptions/sta-141A.html)  
  [STA 141B: Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/courses/expanded-course-descriptions/sta-141B.html)  
- I program in R, C++, C and Python.


  
  
  
  
### Projects  
#### STA 141B Project
- <a href="https://cjacquelineq.github.io/STA141B-Project-House-Price/STA+141B+Project+House+Price.html"> Race, School Ratings, Crime and Real Estate: What affects home price in California?  </a>   Mar 2017  

This project focus on the house price in California and the factor that affact house price. We conducted this project researching the relationship between public school rating and racial composition and their influences in home prices. Moreover, we examine the crime occurrence and house price. And in the end, use web scraping to predict the trend of the house price.

#### STA 141A Project
- <a href="https://cjacquelineq.github.io/ProjectReport.pdf"> World GDP Growth and Population Growth Analysis  </a>   Dec 2016  

This project focus on World GDP Growth and Population Growth. The purposes of the project are to observe the changes of GDP and population from countries over the world and to predict the these variables from the United States.  

#### UC Davis Statistics Research Training Group
- <a href="https://stats.libretexts.org/Core/RTG%3A_Simulating_High_Dimensional_Data/The_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Method"> RTG: Simulating High Dimensional Data  </a>   May 2016  

This project focus on the high dimensional data. In this section, we will discuss some aspects of the Monte Carlo method our team used to simulate high dimensional data. The Monte Carlo methods are basically a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain certain numerical results, and can be used to solve problems that have a probabilistic interpretation.Although using real high-dimensional data is also an option, we more often than not do not know the true distribution of these data points, so what we observe from real data might not always align nicely with theory. However, with simulated data, we can always test to see if what we're expecting is correct if we fix a sample size, dimension, and distribution beforehand.
